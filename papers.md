## Research papers that used hmer as a calibration tool

- [Demonstrating multi-country calibration of a tuberculosis model using new history matching and emulation package - hmer](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.13.22275052v2)
- [The impact of alternative delivery strategies for novel tuberculosis vaccines in low- and middle-income countries: a modelling study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.16.22273762v1)

## Previous work by our group on calibrating infectious disease models using HME, that led to the development of this package:

- [Bayesian History Matching of Complex Infectious Disease Models Using Emulation: A Tutorial and a Case Study on HIV in Uganda](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003968)
- [History matching of a complex epidemiological model of human immunodeficiency virus transmission by using variance emulation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28781386/)
- [Approximate Bayesian Computation and Simulation-Based Inference for Complex Stochastic Epidemic Models](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-33/issue-1/Approximate-Bayesian-Computation-and-Simulation-Based-Inference-for-Complex-Stochastic/10.1214/17-STS618.full)
- [Efficient History Matching of a High Dimensional Individual-Based HIV Transmission Model](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/16M1093008)
- [Universal test, treat, and keep: improving ART retention is key in cost-effective HIV control in Uganda](https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-017-2420-y)

## Additional references

In the two epidemiological papers below, HME was used for the calibration of HIV models:
- [Bayesian History Matching of Complex Infectious Disease Models Using Emulation: A Tutorial and a Case Study on HIV in Uganda](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003968)
- [History matching of a complex epidemiological
model of human immunodeficiency virus
transmission by using variance emulation](https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/id/eprint/4650003/1/History%20matching%20of%20a%20complex%20epidemiological%20model%20of%20human%20immunodeficiency%20virus%20transmission%20by%20using%20variance%20emulation.pdf)

The following papers, where HME was used in disciplines such as astrophysics and biology, contain a more technical and statistical introduction to the method:
- [Galaxy formation : a Bayesian uncertainty analysis](https://dro.dur.ac.uk/8086/)
- [Galaxy Formation: Bayesian History Matching for the Observable Universe](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-29/issue-1/Galaxy-Formation-Bayesian-History-Matching-for-the-Observable-Universe/10.1214/12-STS412.full)
- [Constraints on galaxy formation models from the galaxy stellar mass function and its evolution](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/466/2/2418/2691461)
- [Bayesian uncertainty analysis for complex systems biology models: emulation, global parameter searches and evaluation of gene functions](https://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12918-017-0484-3)
