- [Bayesian History Matching of Complex Infectious Disease Models Using Emulation: A Tutorial and a Case Study on HIV in Uganda](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003968)
- [History matching of a complex epidemiological model of human immunodeficiency virus transmission by using variance emulation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28781386/)
