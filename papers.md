### Previous work by our group on calibrating infectious disease models using HME, that led to the development of this package:

- [Bayesian History Matching of Complex Infectious Disease Models Using Emulation: A Tutorial and a Case Study on HIV in Uganda](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003968)
- [History matching of a complex epidemiological model of human immunodeficiency virus transmission by using variance emulation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28781386/)
- [Approximate Bayesian Computation and Simulation-Based Inference for Complex Stochastic Epidemic Models](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-33/issue-1/Approximate-Bayesian-Computation-and-Simulation-Based-Inference-for-Complex-Stochastic/10.1214/17-STS618.full)
- [Efficient History Matching of a High Dimensional Individual-Based HIV Transmission Model](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/16M1093008)
- [Universal test, treat, and keep: improving ART retention is key in cost-effective HIV control in Uganda](https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-017-2420-y)
