[<- Back to main page](https://hmer-package.github.io/website/)

On **May 24th 2022** we will hold a day-long, in-person workshop **"Calibrating complex models through history matching and emulation: an introduction to the R-package _hmer_"** at the [London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/contact/location) (WC1E 7HT, Keppel Street Building, room LG07). 

Participants will familiarise themselves with the history matching and emulation framework and will learn how to implement such technique to calibrate deterministic and stochastic models using _hmer_. The workshop will be run by a combination of [CMMID](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases) members and external speakers and will consist both of short, introductory presentations and of practical, hands-on tutorials.
