## 24 May 2022 Workshop - An introduction to the R-package _hmer_

This **day-long**, **in-person workshop** took place on **May 24th 2022** at the [London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/contact/location) (WC1E 7HT, Keppel Street Building, room LG07). 

Participants were introduced to the history matching and emulation framework, and learnt how to implement the technique to calibrate models using hmer. In the workshop, we focused on calibrating deterministic models and the mean of stochastic model runs. We also briefly discussed using hmer to calibrate the variance of individual stochastic model runs, which will be explored in more detail in a future workshop.

The workshop was run by a combination of members of the  Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases  at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and external speakers from Durham University and the University of Exeter. It consisted of hands-on, practical tutorials, interspersed with short presentations.
