## New workshop coming soon!

We will be holding an online workshop on the calibration of deterministic and stochastic models before the summer. The exact dates will be announced here. Meanwhile, please sign up to our [mailing list](https://hmer-package.github.io/website/index.html) if you are interested in being notified.

## 8-9 December 2022 Online Workshop - Calibrating deterministic and stochastic models using the hmer package

Due to the high number of registrations for the workshop on 17-18 November (see below), this will be a repeat of the workshop for interested participants who could not sign up for the earlier workshop. The material covered and the programme will be the same in both workshops.

Click [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/calibrating-deterministic-and-stochastic-models-using-the-hmer-package-tickets-430882460037) to register for the 8-9 December workshop. 

## 17-18 November 2022 Online Workshop - Calibrating deterministic and stochastic models using the hmer package

In this two-day online workshop, we will introduce you to the history matching and emulation framework, and guide you through using the technique to calibrate both deterministic and stochastic models (including models with bimodal behaviour) using hmer. The first day of the workshop will deal with the calibration of deterministic models and will therefore be very similar to the workshop “An Introduction to History Matching with Emulation using the R-package hmer” held 24 May 2022. If you took part in that, you can join this workshop directly on the second day, when stochastic models will be analysed.

The workshop will be run by a combination of members of the  Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases  at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and external speakers from Durham University and the University of Exeter. It will consist of hands-on, practical tutorials, interspersed with short presentations.

## 24 May 2022 Workshop - An introduction to the R-package _hmer_

This **day-long**, **in-person workshop** took place on **May 24th 2022** at the [London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/contact/location) (WC1E 7HT, Keppel Street Building, room LG07). 

Participants were introduced to the history matching and emulation framework, and learnt how to implement the technique to calibrate models using hmer. In the workshop, we focused on calibrating deterministic models and briefly discussed calibrating to the mean of stochastic model runs.

The workshop was run by a combination of members of the  Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases  at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and external speakers from Durham University and the University of Exeter. It consisted of hands-on, practical tutorials, interspersed with short presentations.
