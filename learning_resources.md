In this section you will find several resources to learn about the history matching with emulation framework and how to implement such method through the _hmer_ package.

## Resources on HME 

To start familiarising yourself with history matching with emulation, we created a brief introduction to the method, using a simple one-dimensional example:
- [Introduction to HME](https://danny-sc.github.io/Tutorial_1/)

You can also take a look at the following epidemiological papers, where history matching with emulation was used for the calibration of HIV models:
- [Bayesian History Matching of Complex Infectious Disease Models Using Emulation: A Tutorial and a Case Study on HIV in Uganda](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003968)
- [History matching of a complex epidemiological
model of human immunodeficiency virus
transmission by using variance emulation](https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/id/eprint/4650003/1/History%20matching%20of%20a%20complex%20epidemiological%20model%20of%20human%20immunodeficiency%20virus%20transmission%20by%20using%20variance%20emulation.pdf)

## Resources on _hmer_ 

The first resource to learn about _hmer_ is the case study below, which demonstrates the use of _hmer_ for the calibration of a deterministic SEIRS model. 

- [Deterministic tutorial](https://danny-sc.github.io/Tutorial_2/)

We also created a practical tutorial that offers a more interactive introduction to _hmer_. This is also based on a deterministic SEIRS model, but it is more interactive and requires you to complete tasks writing code in R.

Once you have familiarised youself with the calibration of deterministic models, you can work through the stochastic practical tutorial below:
