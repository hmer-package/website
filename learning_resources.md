In this section you will find some resources on the history matching with emulation framework, and how to implement the method using the hmer package.

## Resources on HME 

To start familiarising yourself with history matching with emulation, we created a brief introduction to the method, using a simple one-dimensional example:
- [Introduction to HME](https://danny-sc.github.io/Tutorial_1/)

You can also take a look at the following epidemiological papers, where history matching with emulation was used for the calibration of HIV models:
- [Bayesian History Matching of Complex Infectious Disease Models Using Emulation: A Tutorial and a Case Study on HIV in Uganda](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003968)
- [History matching of a complex epidemiological
model of human immunodeficiency virus
transmission by using variance emulation](https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/id/eprint/4650003/1/History%20matching%20of%20a%20complex%20epidemiological%20model%20of%20human%20immunodeficiency%20virus%20transmission%20by%20using%20variance%20emulation.pdf)

## Resources on _hmer_ 

The first resource to learn about _hmer_ is the tutorial below

- [Deterministic tutorial](https://danny-sc.github.io/Tutorial_2/)

We also created a practical tutorial that offers a more interactive introduction to _hmer_. This is also based on a deterministic SEIRS model, but it is more interactive and requires you to complete tasks writing code in R.

- Deterministic practical tutorial(https://danny-sc.github.io/determ_workshop/)

Once you have familiarised youself with the calibration of deterministic models, you can work through the stochastic practical tutorial below:

- Stochastic practical tutorial (link to be added)

## Template to set up HME on your model 
This repository contains an R-script called _Template_hmer_script_ that will guide you through setting up history matching with emulation on your model of interest.
